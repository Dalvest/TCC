	<text>Welcome to Scrapper space. The scrappers are elusive and don't make a habit of sharing information about their societies among travelers. They simply need scrap.</text>
	<text>The Scrappers focus on acquiring scrap suggests that they prioritize resource acquisition above all else. Their societies are likely centered around scavenging, with social structures, customs, and hierarchies emerging from the need to efficiently collect and utilize resources. Cooperation and sharing of knowledge among Scrappers might occur within their own communities but may not extend readily to outsiders.</text>
	<text>Scrappers seem to have a strong sense of self-reliance and resourcefulness, as they must navigate dangerous and unpredictable environments to find valuable scraps. They possess specialized knowledge about identifying and extracting useful materials from various sources, especially wrecked spacecraft and technological remnants.</text>
